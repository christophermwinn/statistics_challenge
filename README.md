# statistics_challenge

This is the work for the Module 5 challenge involving
data from Pymaceuticals and cancer treatment on
labratory mice.

Data was merged into a single dataframe and analyzed.
Summary statistics were provided.
Bar charts and pie charts were created using both Pandas and Matplotlib.
Finally, statistical analysis was performed for each drug treatment.

Getting some of the regression modeling and statistical information was 
challenging, as was the box plot.
